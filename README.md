# Spongly

I'm a 15-year-old Nepalese IT enthusiast.

I've always been interested in technology, and I'm constantly keen to learn new things and develop myself.

I adore web programming, gaming, and playing with electronics, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my abilities and knowledge in these areas.
