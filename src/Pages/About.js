          <p className="about-p">
            As a 15-year-old IT enthusiast from Nepal, I am passionate about all
            things tech-related. Whether it's exploring the latest programming
            languages, experimenting with new software, or building my own
            devices from scratch, I am constantly seeking out new ways to expand
            my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving field.
          </p>
          <p className="about-p">
            I believe that technology has the power to change the world and make
            a positive impact on people's lives. From improving healthcare to
            increasing access to education, technology has the potential to
            solve some of our greatest challenges and create a better future for
            all.

            While my love for cars and hardware is an important part of my
            interests, I am deeply committed to staying up-to-date with the
            latest developments in the tech industry. Whether it's machine
            learning, blockchain, or virtual reality, I am fascinated by the
            endless possibilities for innovation and creativity in this field.

          <p className="about-p">
            Through my dedication and hard work, I hope to one day make a
            meaningful contribution to the world of technology and inspire
            others to pursue their own passions and interests in this exciting
            and rapidly changing field. Whether it's through creating new
            software applications, designing cutting-edge hardware, or finding
            innovative ways to apply technology to real-world problems, I am
            eager to see where my journey will take me.
